This dataset is information received through a survey done in California.
After a series of 8 questions, it was determined whether or not the adult
has met the recommended criteria for physical activity. The definition of
physical activity was determined by the U.S Department of health as well as
Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, and lastly by the Healthy
People 2020 (Namely through Objectives 2.1 and 2.2)

The data can be separated by total active, sex, age, ethnicity, education, income,
as well as whether or not the person is obese or not.

It should also be noted that the original json data was taken from a csv file and
transposed manually into the index.
